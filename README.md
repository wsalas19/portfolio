# Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website built with Next.js, TypeScript, Supabase, and EmailJS.

## Overview

The home page displays a profile card, experience section, and contact form.

The profile card fetches a profile photo from a Supabase storage bucket and displays it along with other profile details.

The experience section displays previous jobs and education.

The contact form uses EmailJS to send messages directly to my personal email address.
